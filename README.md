A game project I made in Processing back in 2018 for my CGRA151 course project. This game is inspired by Doodle Jump but with slightly different mechanics.</br>
In Unicorn Escape, you play as a unicorn eternally jumping up through fragmented platforms to escape the rising acid below.

To run this game, you will need the Java installed on your machine and the [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/) installed.
